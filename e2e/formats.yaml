    # @todo: the unit should probably change depending in direction
    #   when i was working I found myself doing things like `human size -i
    #   5gb` expecting that to work but it kept throwing an error because the
    #   units were set to iec.
    #
    #   so what I'm thinking is:
    #     when direction is from, then default to iec
    #     when direction is into, then default to si
    - name: "size: It should default to iec"
      test: |
        %%human%% size 5210 | tac | head -n1 | rg '^5.1Ki'

    - name: "size: It should accept --units parameter"
      test: |
        %%human%% size --units si 5000 | tac | head -n1 | rg '^5.0Kb'

        # @notimplementedyet
    # - name: "size: It should fail if units are unknown (or skipped)"
    #   test: |
    #     %%human%% size --units 5000 | %%shouldfail%%
