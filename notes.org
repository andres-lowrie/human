    what is this ?
    perhaps this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_7_Unix
*** Each line has five time and date fields 
*** Feild description
    field         allowed values (all accept * as well)
    -----         --------------
    minute        0-59
    hour          0-23
    day of month  1-31
    month         1-12 (or names, see below)
    day of week   0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)
   
**** A field may be an asterisk (*), which always stands for ``first-last''.
**** ranges are 2 numbers separated by a hyphen 
**** a list is a set of numbers, or ranges, separated by commas
**** steps
***** a value used in conjunction with ranges
      0-6/2 => meaning, 0 to 6 by 2 (0, 2, 4, 6)
      can be used after asterisk ( */2 )
**** names
     cannot be used with ranges, ie: there's not such thing as "mon-wed"
     Can be used for "month" and "day of week". Use first 3 three letters of the
     field
       eg: jan => janurary, wed => wednesday
**** day field
      Note: The day of a command's execution can be specified by two fields --
      day of month, and day of week.  If both fields are restricted (ie, are
      not *), the command will be run when either field matches the current
      time.

       For example, ``30 4 1,15 * 5`` would cause a command to be run at 4:30 am
       on the 1st and 15th of each month, plus every Friday.

       When both "day of month"  and "day of week" are used, they need to have an
       asterisk in front of the day
** more notes
*** structure of human output:
    At ([minute] [hour]) on [dayofmonth] in/of [month] on [dayofweek]

    When both hour and minute are set to Every, then it should output "Every minute"

      " * * * 11 * " => "Every minute of every day in November" or perhaps it can simplify further with
                     => "Every minute of November"
**** every
       "*": "Every" unless followed by a "/", then it has to change to something else
**** lists
       ",": "and" eg: 0,2,4  => "on the hours of 0, 2 and 4"
**** ranges
       "-": "from the x to the y" eg: "0 0 [1-5] * * " => " at midnight from the 1st to the 5th of every month
****  shortcuts/aliases
     midnight             => "0 0 ..."
     am or pm can be used => 4am => "0 4 ..."
                          => 4pm => "0 16 ..."
      
*** examples from docs
    "run five minutes after midnight, every day"        => 5 0 * * *
    "run at 2:15pm on the first of every month"         => 15 14 1 * *
    "run at 10 pm on weekdays"                          => 0 22 * * 1-5
    "run 23 minutes after midn, 2am, 4am ..., everyday" => 23 0-23/2 * * *
    "run at 5 after 4 every sunday"                     => 5 4 * * sun
*** more human-isuqe stuff
     "at 4"                   => Ambiguous, so perhaps it should print both => " 0 4 * * * " | " 0 16 * * * " 
     "on the 5th of november" => Ambiguous, so perhaps it assumes midnight  => " 0 0 5 11 * "
     "every other day"        => Ambiguous time, so perhaps                 => " 0 0 */2 * * "
     "every other month"      => Ambiguous time, so perhaps                 => " 0 0 * */2 * "
     "every other week"       => Ambiguous day, so perhaps                  => " 0 0 * */15 0 "
