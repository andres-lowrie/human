* Refactors
** create a function for parsing each of the time fields
  this way the logic will be easier to follow
** break out range function logic since it's duplicated
** rename CanParseFromMachine into getParts or something in the format package
  since it's going to be used multiple times
  ie, name this function something else and then wrap it with CanParseFromMachine
see format/number.go.Run for info
** cron: output should be controlled via types and not string manipulation
* Working
DoFromMachine cron DayComponent: adding back the previous tests I commented out
need to put the current code into some "known working" state so I can go back and organize the code better
