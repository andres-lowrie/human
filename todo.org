* Refactors
** create a function for parsing each of the time fields (TimeComponent, DayComponent, MonthComponent)
this way the logic will be easier to follow
currently these are the anonymous functions that have the suffix `Tpl` in DoFromMachine function
** break out range function logic since it's duplicated
** rename CanParseFromMachine into getParts or something in the format package
  since it's going to be used multiple times
  ie, name this function something else and then wrap it with CanParseFromMachine
see format/number.go.Run for info
** cron: output should be controlled via types and not string manipulation
ie: the string manipulation should be abstracted until the last moment?
* Working
** TODO finish cron [66%]
- [X] continue adding back tests that are commented out
- [ ] add some sort of "e2e" testing for the entire cli
  this will help iron our the ux and get some sort of v0 out
- [X] write MonthComponent tests
** TODO get e2e working on the 3 parsers
